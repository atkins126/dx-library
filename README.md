#DX.Library Overview
Cross-Platform Library for Delphi / FireMonkey

DX.Library contains various helpers and utilities for Delphi, with a special focus on cross platform development. All code is usually the most current Delphi Version only.

The RTL and FireMonkey support all platfroms from Windows, Mac, iOs to Adroid and are very flexible written. There is still room for utilities though that make your life easier. This is where DX.Library jumps in.

Be aware that the code is in flux. I try to keep breaking changes to a bare minimum, but as Delphi's cross-platform support evolves continuosly there might be required changes.
